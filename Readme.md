# Welcome to the Feedback Page for the abc Triple Search

[Unbeaten](https://abc.tngtech.com) is a crowd computing initiative in order to find exceptional abc triples (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture)).

Please leave your feedback and bug reports here by creating [issues](https://github.com/deltapi/abc-feedback/issues/new/choose). Please keep in mind that Unbeaten is a hobby project and the maintainers will tend to your report as soon as possible but most probably not immediately.
